### Hello WOrld! 👋👋👋

I am Felipe, a Python WebDev  👨🏻‍💻 🐍 

I do speak Spanish, French and English. 

Currently based in Paris I am learning more about Java, Angular, Ionic, SQL and more.

I will be pleased to help you with your Python - Django, Django REST-Framework projects, so do not hesitate!! (Yep, HTML and CSS too). 

Besides coding I also do like Croosfit, Outdoors biking and my Mavic Mini.  🏋️  🚵

You can reach me by email: felipe@henao.me  

Feel free to take a look at my first projet, "OnyGo", and to propose any change to improve the code.
